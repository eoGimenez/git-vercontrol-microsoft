# El git flow para contribuir en repos:

- 1. The first step of the GitHub flow is creating a branch so that the changes, features, and fixes you create don't affect the main branch

- 2. The second step is to make your changes. We recommend deploying changes to your feature branch before merging into the main branch. Doing so ensures the changes are valid in a production environment.

- 3. The third step is to create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback. Pull request review is so valuable that some repositories require an approving review before pull requests can be merged.

- 4. Next is the fourth step of reviewing and implementing your feedback from your collaborators.

- 5. The fifth step, once youâ€™re feeling great about your changes now it's time to get your pull request approved and merge it into the main branch.

- 6. The sixth and final step is to delete your branch. Deleting your branch signals your work on the branch is completed and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.
